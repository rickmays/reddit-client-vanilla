# Vanilla Reddit Client

## Only Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no react/redux, etc)

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course.
I created this as a first step toward fulfilling the requirement to complete a
Reddit client using react/redux. I used this app to get started with the Reddit
JSON API, the search function, and I wanted to see what was possible using just
HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
